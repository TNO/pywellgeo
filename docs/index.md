# PyWellGeo

**PyWellGeo** is a Python library for advanced well trajectory modeling, well data handling, and geothermal engineering workflows.  
It provides tools for representing, analyzing, and visualizing complex well architectures, including multi-branch wells, and supports a variety of input formats and engineering calculations.

## Main Features

- Flexible well trajectory modeling (vertical, deviated, multi-branch)
- Well data utilities (water properties, constants, DC1D well models)
- Well tree structures for advanced branching and perforation logic
- Geometric transformations (azimuth/dip, vector math)
- Integration with geothermal techno-economic workflows
